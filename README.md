This algorithm finds the maximum clique in a graph and is inspired by the following document: 

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278716368_A_review_on_algorithms_for_maximum_clique_problems.

The project has not been completed, and in the near future, I will attempt to improve it.

At this address, you can find some DIMACS graphs.

To find a clique in a graph, simply execute the following command in the terminal:

```
java -jar solver.jar brock200-2.mtx
```
